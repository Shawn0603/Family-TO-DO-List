# To-Do List

**To-Do List** is a clean, minimal, and user-friendly task management web application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. It allows users to quickly add, complete, delete, and restore tasks — all with a beautiful and intuitive interface.

This project is designed as a foundation for a fully functional mobile and desktop app, with the long-term goal of publishing it to the **App Store**. It demonstrates a solid understanding of component-based architecture, local data persistence, and interactive UI development in modern front-end technologies.
